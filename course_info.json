Faculty members may also be available to provide some guidance if this is needed.","What if I don't pass the modules?","If you fail any of the modules you can retake the examination. \u00a0There is no limit to the number of times you can retake but you cannot join the MSc until you have passed all the required modules.","How much will the programme cost?","Each module examination will cost AED 500. \u00a0If you do not pass the examination at the first attempt an exam fee of AED 500 will be charged for re-taking the examination.

Employment of environmental scientists globally is expected to increase by 25 percent between 2006 and 2016, much faster than the average for all occupations.","What is Environmental Science?","Environmental Science is the study of the relationship between physical, chemical and biological processes in the environment with a view to solving environmental problems.","Why Study Environmental Science?","Today we face many challenging environmental issues with potentially disastrous consequences if these issues are not addressed. Global climate change, the loss of biodiversity, increased frequency of floods and droughts, increased energy demands, rising volumes of waste are but just a few examples of the significant pressures on the environment.","Something has to be done to address these above issues and this is why environmental science is an important area to study.","Environmental Scientists: Their Role and Employment Opportunities","Environmental Scientists monitor the quality of the environment and develop strategies and solutions for dealing with environmental problems. In addition, environmental scientists help planners develop and construct buildings, transportation systems, and utilities that protect water resources and enable the efficient and beneficial use of land.","Currently, worldwide, the majority of Environmental Scientists are employed in governmental positions, but job opportunities are opening up in the private sector spurred largely by the increasing demands placed on companies to be responsive to the need to protect the environment and to comply with laws and regulations relating to ground-water decontamination, clean air, and flood control.","Employment of environmental scientists globally is expected to increase by 25 percent between 2006 and 2016, much faster than the average for all occupations.","The Abu Dhabi University undergraduate degree program in Environmental Science will appeal to those who have an interest in learning more about the environment, in developing an understanding of environmental processes and issues, and in developing solutions to environmental problems.","The Abu Dhabi University BSc in Environmental Science","The program will include study of topics and issues such as:","Introduction to environmental science.","The basic concepts of conservation.","Protected areas and eco-tourism.","The management of waste and water resources.","The effect of the eco-system on plants, animals and birds.","Oceanography .","Marine science .","Marine biodiversity.","Marine endangered species.","The management of coastal habitats .","Air and water pollution.","The ozone layer.","The greenhouse effect.","Environmental crisis management.","Sheikha Latifa Bint Hamdan Al Nahyan Scholarships","Abu Dhabi University is proud to announce the launch of the highly anticipated Sheikha Latifa Bint Hamdan Al Nahyan Environmental Science Scholarships.

The College also offers a Master of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering program (MEngECE). The MSECE program offers students opportunities for advanced education in the field of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), thus producing engineers with state-of-the-art specialized technical knowledge and skills who are ready to serve as experts in their fields and\/or to pursue PhD degrees in ECE. The MEngECE, on the other hand, responds to regional and international market demand for engineers with a blend of advanced ECE and Engineering Management backgrounds, thus preparing the Electrical and Computer Engineering project managers of tomorrow. The MSECE program has a coursework option and a thesis option. In the coursework option, students are required to complete 10 graduate-level courses (30 credit hours) in addition to a capstone project (3 credit hours). For the thesis option, students complete 9 graduate-level courses (27 credit hours) and a thesis (6 credit hours). The program accepts students with bachelor\u2019s degrees in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or related fields. Students who lack the necessary background in certain topics, as per their undergraduate transcript, may be admitted conditionally.
